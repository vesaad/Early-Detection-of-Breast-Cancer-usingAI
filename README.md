Early Detection of Breast Cancer with AI 
This project aims to show how artificial intelligence can help in the early detection of breast cancer using machine learning algorithms. Breast cancer is one of the most common diseases in women, and early detection is very important for better treatment. This project was created as part of Breast Cancer Awareness Month to highlight the importance of technology in supporting early diagnosis. In this project, we use a dataset with information about breast cancer. The data includes features like size, shape, and texture. There are two types of diagnoses: M (malignant), which means the cancer is dangerous, and B (benign), which means the cancer is not dangerous. Two AI methods are used: Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes. Logistic Regression is used to predict whether a cancer is malignant or benign. Naive Bayes is used for comparison with Logistic Regression. The main steps of the work are: loading the dataset, cleaning the data, splitting it into train and test sets, standardizing the data, training the models, and evaluating the results. After training, the Logistic Regression model showed high accuracy in predictions and proved to be a simple but effective method for early detection. Naive Bayes was also used to compare results. In the end, the results and confusion matrix are presented to show how well the model separates benign and malignant cancers. This project shows that AI does not replace doctors but helps them make faster and more accurate decisions.
